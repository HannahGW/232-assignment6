### ODE
```{r}
# Run the model for 300 years (using the ODE solver)  starting with an initial forest size of 10 kg/C, and using the following parameters: canopy closure threshold of 50 kgC , K = 250 kg C (carrying capacity) , r=  0.01 (exponential growth rate before before canopy closure), g = 2 kg/year (linear growth rate after canopy closure)


```


### Sobel Sensitivity
```{r}
# Run a sobol sensitivity analysis that explores how the estimated maximum and mean forest size (e.g maximum and mean values of C over the 300 years) varies with the pre canopy closure growth rate (r) and post-canopy closure growth rate (g) and canopy closure threshold and carrying capacity(K)

# Assume that they are all normally distributed with means as given above and standard deviation of 10% of mean value

# Graph the results of the sensitivity analysis as a box plot of maximum forest size and a plot of the two sobol indices (S and T)
```
